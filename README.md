# Rust by example 

According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021 conducted among over 80,000 developers, Rust is the most beloved programming language. And it won the title for the sixth year running.

# A language that provides control, safety, without performance decreases 

Historically, a developer chose either full control over aspects such memory management via a programming language, e.g. *c++* - with little safety conerns that come with the management of it. Or a language that provides full safety, e.g. *Python* where one has little control over lower level details of memory management at the cost of performance decrease. 

**Rust is a language that provides both; safety and control, without sacrificing speed**



# *What sparked my interest in it?*

Review the [Meili search engine](https://www.meilisearch.com/), as an example of the type of application ideally implemented with Rust. It is nothing short of blazing fast.

This repository concerns itself with learning the langauge itself, via following the [rust by example guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).
